# Pagoda Engine

_Pagoda game engine_ is an interactive novel/text game engine.

It's aim is to provide an easy way of creating interactive
content such as novels, adventure games and such, all based
on the old school _"text game paradigm"_, but on steroids.

The main features are:

- Markdown based narrative text.
- Images/sprite rendering.
- Interactive actions.
- A custom scripting language, that is designed to resemble a script.
